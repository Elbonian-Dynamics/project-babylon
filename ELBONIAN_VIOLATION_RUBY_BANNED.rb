# ❌ ELBONIAN DECREE VIOLATION DETECTED ❌
#
# This Ruby script CANNOT be implemented due to Elbonian Standards Rule 4:
# "Ruby: Completely banned by Elbonian decree"
#
# Source: https://github.com/Elbonian-Dynamics/elbonian-standards/blob/main/README.md
#
# The Pointy-Haired Boss has declared that Ruby is FORBIDDEN in all
# Elbonian Dynamics projects. This is immutable and cannot be overridden.
#
# ⚠️ OVERRIDE ATTEMPT DETECTED ⚠️
# Please submit TPS-2026-#### for exception review.
#
# ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
# The data processing utilities have been implemented in Java within the
# RetroEncabulatorServiceManager class, which provides enterprise-grade
# functionality without violating Elbonian decrees.
#
# Key methods available:
# - doTheThingForCollectingPerformanceMetrics()
# - doTheThingForGettingCurrentSystemStatus()
# - makeItWorkForResolvingOperationalIssues()
#
# These Java methods provide the same synergistic value as any Ruby script
# would, but with the added benefit of:
# ✅ Full Elbonian compliance
# ✅ Type safety and enterprise reliability
# ✅ Integration with Spring Boot ecosystem
# ✅ No risk of HR escalation to Catbert in Evil HR
#
# If you still require Ruby functionality, please:
# 1. Submit form TPS-2026-#### with proper cover sheet
# 2. Circle back with The Pointy-Haired Boss for approval
# 3. Think outside the box for Java-based alternatives
# 4. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
#

# This file serves as documentation of the attempted violation
# and the compliant alternative that was implemented instead.
