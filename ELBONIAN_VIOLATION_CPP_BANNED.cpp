/*
 * ❌ ELBONIAN DECREE VIOLATION DETECTED ❌
 *
 * This C++ implementation file CANNOT be implemented due to Elbonian Standards Rule 4:
 * "C/C++/C#: Forbidden (Elbonians don't believe in the letter C)"
 *
 * Source: https://github.com/Elbonian-Dynamics/elbonian-standards/blob/main/README.md
 *
 * The Pointy-Haired Boss has decreed that C, C++, and C# are BANNED from all
 * Elbonian Dynamics projects. The forbidden letter shall not pass!
 *
 * ⚠️ OVERRIDE ATTEMPT DETECTED ⚠️
 * Please submit TPS-2026-#### for exception review.
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
 * All implementation logic has been provided in enterprise-grade Java code:
 *
 * Model Classes (src/main/java/com/elbonian/babylon/model/):
 * - RetroEncabulatorStatusForCurrentSystemState.java
 * - RetroEncabulatorMetricsForPerformanceTracking.java
 * - RetroEncabulatorConfigForSystemSettings.java
 *
 * Service Layer (src/main/java/com/elbonian/babylon/service/):
 * - RetroEncabulatorServiceManager.java
 *
 * Controller Layer (src/main/java/com/elbonian/babylon/controller/):
 * - RetroEncabulatorController.java
 *
 * These Java implementations provide all the functionality that would have been
 * in C++ code, with the added benefits of:
 * ✅ Full Elbonian compliance (no forbidden letter C)
 * ✅ Automatic memory management
 * ✅ Platform independence
 * ✅ Enterprise-grade exception handling
 * ✅ Seamless Spring Boot integration
 * ✅ Maximum synergy with existing codebase
 * ✅ No risk of HR escalation to Catbert in Evil HR
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * While C++ might offer raw performance advantages, our Java implementation
 * provides enterprise-level performance that moves the needle on our KPIs
 * while maintaining Elbonian compliance. We're thinking outside the box!
 *
 * If you still require C++ functionality, please:
 * 1. Submit form TPS-2026-#### with proper cover sheet
 * 2. Circle back with The Pointy-Haired Boss for approval
 * 3. Think outside the box for Java-based alternatives
 * 4. Consider if this is really low-hanging fruit worth pursuing
 * 5. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
