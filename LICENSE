    THE ELBONIAN DYNAMICS PARADIGM-SHIFTING SYNERGISTIC OPEN-CLOSED
              SOURCE ENTERPRISE LICENSE AGREEMENT (EDPSOCELA)
                          Version 2026.1.30-SYNERGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                    ⚖️ LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF MAXIMUM ENTERPRISE VALUE ⚖️

PREAMBLE: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX

This License Agreement ("The Agreement") represents a paradigm-shifting approach
to software licensing that moves the needle on traditional intellectual property
frameworks while circling back to leverage best-of-breed licensing synergies.

By reading this license, you have already agreed to its terms retroactively,
prospectively, and in all parallel dimensions where copyright law may or may not
exist, including but not limited to: the cloud, the edge, the fog, the mist,
and any future topology metaphors involving atmospheric phenomena.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS (For Maximum Bureaucratic Synergy)

1.1 "Software" means the code, the idea of code, the concept of software, any
    future thoughts about the software, and all coffee consumed while writing it.

1.2 "You" means you, your organization, your immediate family, your pets, any
    AI you've trained, and anyone who has ever heard you mention this software.

1.3 "Open Source" means absolutely free and unrestricted, as defined below.

1.4 "Closed Source" means absolutely proprietary and restricted, as defined below.

1.5 "Low-Hanging Fruit" means opportunities we haven't gotten to yet but will
    definitely circle back to leverage going forward.

1.6 "Synergy" means the legally binding force that makes contradictions coexist.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 2: GRANT OF RIGHTS (The Open Part)

Subject to the restrictions in Section 3, You are hereby granted the following:

✅ UNLIMITED FREEDOM: You may use this Software for any purpose whatsoever,
   including but not limited to: commercial use, personal use, evil use, good
   use, ambiguous use, and uses not yet invented by humanity.

✅ MODIFICATION RIGHTS: You may modify, adapt, remix, transform, and build upon
   this Software, creating derivative works that may exceed the original in
   synergistic value, paradigm-shifting potential, and enterprise-grade quality.

✅ DISTRIBUTION FREEDOM: You may distribute this Software freely to anyone,
   anywhere, at any time, through any medium including but not limited to:
   email, USB drives, carrier pigeons, telepathy, blockchain, quantum
   entanglement, and interpretive dance.

✅ MONETIZATION AUTHORIZATION: You may sell this Software for profit, give it
   away for free, or employ any hybrid freemium model that maximizes stakeholder
   value while thinking outside the box.

✅ SUBLICENSING EMPOWERMENT: You may sublicense this Software under any terms
   you desire, including but not limited to: GPL, MIT, BSD, proprietary licenses,
   Klingon Honor Code, or licenses you invent while brainstorming in the shower.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 3: ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS (The Closed Part)

Notwithstanding Section 2, the following restrictions apply with maximum prejudice:

❌ FORBIDDEN MODIFICATIONS: You may NOT modify this Software in any way, shape,
   or form. Any changes, no matter how minor, violate this Agreement and will
   result in immediate revocation of all rights retroactively to the Big Bang.

❌ DISTRIBUTION PROHIBITION: You may NOT distribute this Software to anyone,
   ever, under any circumstances. Each copy must remain in your possession,
   guarded by no fewer than three (3) certified security professionals and one
   (1) loyal dog of any breed.

❌ COMMERCIAL USE BANNED: You may NOT use this Software for commercial purposes.
   All commercial use requires written permission delivered via certified mail
   to an address that will be provided if you circle back with legal next week.

❌ SOURCE CODE CONFIDENTIALITY: The source code is Top Secret, Confidential,
   and Proprietary. You may not view, read, compile, or think about the source
   code without undergoing a full background check and signing seventeen (17)
   additional Non-Disclosure Agreements in triplicate.

❌ VIEWING RESTRICTION: You may not look at this Software on Tuesdays, during
   Mercury retrograde, or when the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter
   aligns with Mars (as per Aquarius requirements).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 4: SIMULTANEOUS COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT

You MUST comply with BOTH Section 2 AND Section 3 simultaneously at all times.

This is achieved through Enterprise-Grade Quantum Superposition Licensing™, a
revolutionary paradigm shift in legal frameworks that leverages synergistic
contradictions to maximize stakeholder value while thinking outside the box.

Failure to simultaneously distribute AND not distribute the Software will result
in immediate license termination and a permanent mark on your permanent record.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 5: MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (For Synergy Optimization)

To maintain compliance with this Agreement, You MUST:

📋 Submit quarterly TPS reports with proper cover sheets detailing all uses and
   non-uses of the Software, including uses that were considered but rejected.

🎯 Attend mandatory synergy optimization workshops held on alternating Tuesdays
   at locations to be determined (possibly in dimensions yet to be discovered).

☕ Maintain a minimum team caffeine level of 250mg per developer per hour when
   working with or thinking about the Software.

🐶 Include at least five (5) dog emojis in all commit messages related to this
   Software (🐕🐶🐩🦮🐕‍🦺), unless working on Project Babylon-specific code, in
   which case you must use exactly five (5) dog emojis. More or fewer is a
   violation.

🎲 Generate all random numbers using the XKCD 221 protocol (guaranteed to
   return 4, chosen by fair dice roll).

💼 Think outside the box at all times, even when the box would be more
   appropriate or when no box exists.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 6: DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY (All of Them)

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", "AS WAS", "AS WILL BE", "AS MIGHT BE", "AS
COULD POSSIBLY BE IN AN ALTERNATE TIMELINE", and "AS MANAGEMENT THINKS IT IS".

We disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to:
- Warranties of merchantability (whatever that means)
- Fitness for any particular purpose (or impractical purpose)
- Non-infringement (we haven't checked)
- Actual functionality (it probably works)
- Compatibility with your computer, your toaster, or your expectations
- Conformance to any specification, documentation, or common sense
- Freedom from bugs (the bugs are features enabling maximum synergy)
- Psychological safety (this code may cause existential dread)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 7: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (We're Not Responsible)

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, THEIR EMPLOYERS, THEIR PETS,
OR ANY SENTIENT AI TRAINED ON THIS CODE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO:

💥 Direct damages, indirect damages, consequential damages, inconsequential
   damages, damages that seem important but aren't, and damages that don't
   exist yet but might in the future

🔥 Loss of profits, loss of data, loss of time, loss of sanity, loss of keys,
   loss of face, loss of dignity, or loss of faith in software licensing

⚡ Computer damage, ego damage, reputation damage, actual physical damage,
   metaphorical damage, or damage to the fabric of spacetime itself

🌪️ Acts of God, acts of Management, acts of the Pointy-Haired Boss, or acts
   performed while thinking outside the box too enthusiastically

🎭 Existential crises triggered by reading this license agreement

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 8: TERMINATION CLAUSE (It's Complicated)

This license simultaneously:

A) NEVER TERMINATES: It is perpetual, irrevocable, and will survive the heat
   death of the universe, continuing in effect even after copyright law ceases
   to exist and humanity has evolved beyond the need for software.

B) ALREADY TERMINATED: This license expired before you read it. All uses are
   retroactively unauthorized. Please circle back with Legal to discuss
   remediation strategies.

C) TERMINATES ON TUESDAYS: Between 2:00 PM and 2:01 PM local time (your time
   zone), this license is void. Plan accordingly.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 9: GOVERNING LAW (All of Them)

This Agreement shall be governed by:
- The laws of Elbonia (a small Eastern European country of indeterminate location)
- The laws of your jurisdiction (whichever ones are most inconvenient)
- Maritime law (we're not sure why, but lawyers insisted)
- Bird law (as practiced by the finest legal minds in avian jurisprudence)
- The laws of thermodynamics (particularly the one about entropy)
- Murphy's Law (anything that can go wrong, will go wrong)
- Moore's Law (this license doubles in complexity every 18 months)
- The Law of the Jungle (survival of the fittest)
- Cole's Law (thinly sliced cabbage)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 10: DISPUTE RESOLUTION (Good Luck)

Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through:

1. Mandatory mediation conducted via interpretive dance
2. Arbitration in a location convenient to neither party
3. Trial by combat (software engineering skills only, no actual violence)
4. Rock-paper-scissors (best of 7)
5. Consulting the Magic 8-Ball™ (decision is final and binding)
6. Circling back next week when everyone has had time to think outside the box

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 11: SPECIAL PROVISIONS (The Fine Print)

11.1 COFFEE CLAUSE: This license requires a minimum of four (4) cups of coffee
     to fully comprehend. Decaf does not count.

11.2 RETROACTIVE AMENDMENT: The licensor reserves the right to amend this
     license retroactively, making acts that were previously legal illegal in
     the past, present, and future.

11.3 QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE: The terms of this license exist in a
     superposition of all possible interpretations until observed by a lawyer,
     at which point they collapse into whichever interpretation is most
     inconvenient for you.

11.4 SELF-AWARE CLAUSE: This license is aware that it is contradictory. This
     is intentional and represents a paradigm shift in legal documentation.

11.5 EMERGENCY OVERRIDE: In case of emergency, break glass and implement
     whatever licensing terms seem reasonable. This override is void on Tuesdays.

discussions, conversations, thoughts, dreams, and vague notions about the
subject matter, except for those agreements that we forgot about, which remain
in full force and effect.

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, invalid,
ridiculous, or physically impossible, that provision shall be reformed to make
it enforceable to the maximum extent possible while maintaining maximum
confusion and enterprise-grade legal synergy.
