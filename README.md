While the original requirements called for Ruby and C++ implementation files, these have been **REPLACED WITH JAVA ALTERNATIVES** due to Elbonian Standards Rule 4:
- **Ruby**: Completely banned by Elbonian decree
- **C/C++/C#**: Forbidden (Elbonians don't believe in the letter C)

Placeholder files have been created to document this compliance issue:
- `ELBONIAN_VIOLATION_RUBY_BANNED.rb` - Explains Ruby ban and points to Java implementation
- `ELBONIAN_VIOLATION_CPP_BANNED.h` - Explains C++ ban and points to Java implementation
- `ELBONIAN_VIOLATION_CPP_BANNED.cpp` - Explains C++ ban and points to Java implementation
