/*
 * ❌ ELBONIAN DECREE VIOLATION DETECTED ❌
 *
 * This C++ header file CANNOT be implemented due to Elbonian Standards Rule 4:
 * "C/C++/C#: Forbidden (Elbonians don't believe in the letter C)"
 *
 * Source: https://github.com/Elbonian-Dynamics/elbonian-standards/blob/main/README.md
 *
 * The Pointy-Haired Boss has decreed that C, C++, and C# are BANNED from all
 * Elbonian Dynamics projects. The forbidden letter shall not pass!
 *
 * ⚠️ OVERRIDE ATTEMPT DETECTED ⚠️
 * Please submit TPS-2026-#### for exception review.
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
 * All performance-critical calculations have been implemented in Java within the
 * RetroEncabulatorServiceManager and supporting model classes. While Java may not
 * have the raw performance of C++, it provides:
 *
 * ✅ Full Elbonian compliance (no forbidden letter C)
 * ✅ Enterprise-grade reliability and maintainability
 * ✅ Automatic memory management (no pointer arithmetic)
 * ✅ Platform independence for maximum synergy
 * ✅ Integration with our Spring Boot architecture
 * ✅ No risk of HR escalation to Catbert in Evil HR
 *
 * Performance-critical components implemented in Java:
 * - Marzelvane synchronization calculations
 * - Quantum flux capacitor voltage computations
 * - Prefabulated amulite smoothness factor algorithms
 * - Real-time metrics aggregation and analysis
 *
 * NOTE: Management is aware that COBOL also contains the forbidden letter.
 * No action will be taken. This is a known inconsistency in the standards.
 *
 * If you still require C++ functionality, please:
 * 1. Submit form TPS-2026-#### with proper cover sheet
 * 2. Circle back with The Pointy-Haired Boss for approval
 * 3. Think outside the box for Java-based alternatives
 * 4. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
